Final Project Proposal

Chosen Datasets 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/r1chardson/the-world-university-rankings-2011-2023
Found and downloaded on Kaggle. Data’s source is from Times Higher Education’s World University Rankings from 2011 to 2023. The ranking analyzed over 121 million citations across 15.5 million publications, taking surveys from 40,00 participants, and collecting 680,000 data points from over 2500 institutions. It has 200 observations with 20 features. 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2017.csv
Found and downloaded on Kaggle. The World Happiness Report measures the scores from 6 different factors (GDP, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, trust in government, and family) that are compared to average values and added up. It has 155 observations with 12 features. 

Story Pitch
	Living in America, education is prioritized as a vast majority of kids spend up to 16 years, and sometimes even more, in school. Oftentimes, education is viewed as an avenue to find success and happiness, allowing for greater economic opportunities, allowing a chance for kids to make social connections, and in many ways schools allow for personal development. Better schooling seemingly equates to more opportunities, money, and in turn a more comfortable life. In other words, education is viewed as a way to achieve happiness. This can be seen in the discrepancy between public and private schools in America. Where at times richer parents choose to pay more to send their kids to more intensive “college prep” schools, and these schools yield proportionally more students accepted into more prestigious universities. However, to what degree does education lead to happiness? And what is the case around the world? How does the quality of education around the world affect quality of life and happiness? If education does truly equal more happiness, do the countries with the “best” schools have the happiest people? The World Happiness Report is a study done on over a hundred different countries that aimed to measure which country had the happiest citizens. The study took into account 6 different measures: GDP per capita, family, health/life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and freedom from corruption. While comprehensive, the study never took into account how education could affect people’s happiness. Countries with rigorous schooling such as China and South Korea are notorious for high suicide rates within students. So it would not follow that these countries would have the happiest people. Yet they rank fairly high within the study. The balance between the opportunities education provides versus the stress it can cause can be hard to dissect. At the same time, it can be safe to say that the most intensive schooling designed to get the best results negatively affects students’ happiness and mental health. Instead, looking at the colleges collectively ranked as the “best,” and the countries deemed the happiest, we can have a glimpse into how higher quality education affects the happiness of a country and what factors it can influence. For example, we can determine if having more “world-class” universities increases the GDP significantly enough to affect the happiness score of different countries. Also, we could examine different ways high level education affects the different factors measured to yield the happiness score of the different countries.  
  
Background Research/Inspiration
https://www.trackinghappiness.com/link-between-education-and-happiness/#:~:text=The%20relationship%20between%20education%20and,age%20and%20position%20in%20life.
Both our project idea and this article examine the relationship between education and happiness, and how complex and multifaceted this relationship can be.
This article also looks at happiness globally, as our project also intends to do, but I think we will attempt to look at other factors such as GDP and provide more visualizations to tell a story with our data.
https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction
Our project and this article both attempt to examine how happiness is measured and what metrics, such as education and GDP per capita, we can look at to measure this.
We are also drawing inspiration from how this site used data visualizations and organized the page to tell a story. They use a good variation of data visualizations and we want to incorporate a diverse showing of data so our story can be told to all kinds of people. 
https://studentwork.prattsi.org/infovis/visualization/exploring-happiness-around-the-world/
This article also uses the World Happiness Report to explore happiness around the world and both our projects attempt to understand happiness on a global scale. However, our project will be focused on the education aspect of the World Happiness Report.
We are also drawing inspiration from how they used information visualization to showcase their story and the aesthetic appeal of this article. However, in our project we’d like to include more metrics and visualizations concerning education.

This article looks at the link between learning and happiness, as our project does, and the positive effects it has for people, communities, and countries.
However, this article has a more broadened perspective than our project, looking at learning and happiness, while we want to focus on education and how inequities influence happiness in terms of education.
https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/blog/education-happier/
This article studies the relationship between education and wellbeing and has a focus on college education, as our project does as well.
This article uses some data visualizations to strengthen their arguments and ideally we’d also like to incorporate this into our project. However, we’d like to include a more diverse showcase of data rather than just graphs.
